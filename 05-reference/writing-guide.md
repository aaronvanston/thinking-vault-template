# Writing Guide (Generic)

This vault encourages lightweight, high-signal writing.

## Defaults

- Prefer short paragraphs (1–3 sentences).
- Use headings to chunk thinking.
- Use bullets when listing.
- Link concepts/people as you write: `[[concept]]`, `[[person]]`.

## The Capture → Process → Ship Loop

1. **Capture** quickly into `00-inbox/`.
2. **Process** by extracting:
   - Summary
   - Key quotes (if applicable)
   - Insight (why it matters)
   - Links to concepts/people
3. **Ship** occasionally into `04-outputs/`.

## “Insight” Prompt

When you’re stuck, answer:
- What do I believe now that I didn’t before?
- What would I do differently tomorrow?
- What’s the non-obvious connection?

## Templates

- Full templates: `05-reference/templates/`
- Section snippets: `05-reference/templates/sections.md`
