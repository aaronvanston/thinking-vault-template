# Systems Design

## Definition

Systems design is the practice of shaping how components interact — boundaries, contracts, failure modes — so the overall system stays reliable and easy to change.

## Why It Matters

- It's where most long-term leverage lives.
- Good systems design compounds; bad design creates drag.

## Examples

- Designing an API boundary that limits blast radius.
- Choosing a data model that fits your access patterns.
- Building in observability from the start.
