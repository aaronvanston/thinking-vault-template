# Taste

## Definition

Taste is the ability to make good decisions under uncertainty: what to build, what to ignore, and how to shape a system so it stays coherent.

## Why It Matters

- As coding gets cheaper, the constraint moves to judgment.
- Taste is what separates "works" from "works well."

## Examples

- Choosing a simple interface over a clever one.
- Cutting scope early to ship.
- Knowing when to break the rules.
