# Thinking Vault Template

This is a **template vault** designed to be safe to share.

## How To Work In This Repo

- Read `CLAUDE.md` first (vault operating manual).
- Keep captures in `00-inbox/`.
- Move processed items to `01-archive/`.
- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to connect ideas.

## Git Workflow

Commit after completing a logical unit of work.

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Describe what changed" && git push
```

## Agent Files

- `AGENTS.md` — this file (quick start)
- `CLAUDE.md` — detailed operating manual

Both live at the root. No nested copies needed.
